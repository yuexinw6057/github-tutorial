## Git vs. GitHub
<p5> Hello there reader, do you know what is the difference between git and github? 
If not, you have came to the right spot. At first, I was confused too, but it is really not that hard. 
<i> What is git? </i> You may ask: 
Git is the system that creates mostly all the contents on github, allowing changes and edits onto the website.
There are also commands under the name of "git" some examples consists of: 
git init, git add, git commit. <i> speaking of git init, let's go to our next point of git init. </i> </p5>

## Initial Setup
<p3> To start an intial setup in order for github and git to work together, you would have to first use a git command call: <br />
git init <br /> </p3>

<p> Now at this point, you may ask yourself: <i> What exactly does git init do? </i> <br /> 
The command git init makes a brand new repository. Which in plain english meaning that nothing is in there, think of it as a empty clean box.
It initializes git. </p>
